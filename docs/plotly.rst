Plotly
======

The plotting function for cloudy mountain plots is built on top of the freely available :doc:`plotly` graphic library.

You can refer to the excellent `Plot.ly <https://plot.ly/>`_ documentation to modify the layout, create subplots, retouch the subtraces or directly modify the cloudy mountain plot source code to add your own features to it.

Hands-on
--------

A good way to try out the several features of cmplot is to clone from github,
or to directly :download:`download the Julia <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/g-insana/CMPlot.jl/master/cmplot_julia_with_examples.ipynb>` or the :download:`Python jupyter notebook <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/g-insana/cmplot.py/master/cmplot_python3_with_examples.ipynb>` and play with it,
tweaking options, trying different data combinations and using your own data or
other publicly available datasets (the notebook uses in the examples the datasets from
Iris [Anderson_Edgar_Fisher_1935_1936]_ and Wages [Cornwell_Rupert_1988]_ but it
is immediate to switch to other datasets via the included calls to
`RDatasets <https://github.com/JuliaStats/RDatasets.jl>`_ - for Julia -
and `PyDatasets <https://github.com/iamaziz/PyDataset>`_ - for Python).

The jupyter notebook can be previewed via `nbviewer.jupyter.org <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/g-insana/cmplot.py/blob/master/cmplot_python3_with_examples.ipynb>`_.
